## Self-Assessment

As I look back at my journey through the computer science program and the development of my ePortfolio, I can say that I have definitely grown in both the technical and professional sense. This program has helped me to refine my strengths, strengthen my weaknesses, learn new tools and practices, and prepare myself for the software development industry. Completing this ePortfolio gave me the opportunity to look back at past projects, enhance them with new skills I have developed, and clearly showcase my abilities. 

Throughout the program, I’ve gained hands-on experience in important areas of computer science. These include software design, algorithms and data structures, and databases. My first artifact, a GUI investment calculator, shows how I was able to transform a basic C++ console app into a working Python application with a modern-looking GUI. This demonstrates my growth in software engineering and UI design, as well as my ability to adapt solutions across different programming languages. 

My second artifact, a Binary Search Tree, shows my ability to work with complex data structures and apply efficient sorting and filtering algorithms. Enhancing this artifact involved adding user-defined filters and sorting logic, which helped deepen my understanding of algorithmic thinking and performance-first design. To filter the data, the code performs an in-order traversal of the BST with a time complexity of O(n). Once filtered, the results are sorted based on the user selection using `std::sort`, which runs at O(m log m), where *m* is the number of filtered bids. This approach maintains low time complexity while providing the user with the desired functionality. 

My third and final artifact is a Dash-based dashboard built on top of a MongoDB data set, which showcases my full-stack development abilities. The enhancement for this artifact included multiple UI improvements, new filters and sort options, and an optimized backend for database queries. It represents my ability to bridge front-end design with backend data handling and demonstrates how I can build interactive tools to help users make informed decisions.

These projects also show my ability to collaborate and communicate effectively. This is evident in how I approached system design for different users and audiences. From my enhancement planning to my code review video, I practiced translating technical ideas and code into easy-to-understand language. This experience also highlighted the importance of security, as I implemented validation for user input and improved how data is handled in all of the applications. For example, in artifact three, database credentials are stored in environment variables, preventing them from being exposed in the code.

In addition to technical growth, this program has helped shape my professional goals. I’ve realized that I enjoy building automation environments and data-driven applications that solve real-world problems. I’m especially interested in careers that combine data automation with decision-making support. In these roles, I can continue applying my skills in UI, data structures, databases, and scalable system design.

Overall, this ePortfolio brings together the strongest examples of my work from the past two years, combined with the knowledge I’ve gained in the field over the past four years. It shows how I’ve progressed as a computer scientist. Each artifact highlights a unique aspect of my skill set, but together they demonstrate my well-rounded ability to design, build, and develop usable applications. I’m excited to take this experience into the next steps of my career!
