      <h2>Artifact Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This artifact is a dashboard to display data built with Dash, MongoDB,
        and Plotly. It was originally made for CS 340: Database Design and
        Maintenance. The purpose of this dashboard it to allow users to view
        and filter an animal shelter database. The original version connected
        to a MongoDB database and supported basic displays. For this
        enhancement, I improved the user interface, filtering capabilities,
        and cleaned up the layout.

      <h3>Justification</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Modernized layout using Dash components.</li>
        <li>
          Added multiple layers of filtering using dropdowns and radio
          buttons.
        </li>
        <li>Enabled dynamic sorting by user-selected fields.</li>
        <li>Fixed map logic to reflect selected data properly.</li>
        <li>Updated pie chart to show all breeds.</li>
        <li>Implemented conditional UI rendering to improve UX.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Program Outcomes Demonstrated</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Professional Communication:</strong> Made a user-friendly
          dashboard using tools like Dash and Plotly
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical Implementation:</strong> Demonstrated full-stack
          development by integrating MongoDB with a well made and user
          friendly Dash frontend, while incorporating advanced filtering and
          sorting features.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Collaborative Environments:</strong> Created a tool to help
          decision making, that could be easily adapted by different teams or
          stakeholders to show animal shelter data effectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security Mindset:</strong> Improved data secruity by using
          environment variables for credentials and efficient MongoDB queries
          to prevent unneeded data exposure.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        This enhancement helped me better understand how frontend design can
        be impacted by backend data handling, and the other way around. One
        challenge with this was making sure the filters and visualizations
        stayed consistent. Another challenge was making sure the proper data
        was pulled for the database. Because you could pull the data then
        filter it but that is a waste of resources when you could pull just
        the needed data first. I also learned better practices for MongoDB
        querying and Pandas based data frames. Overall this enhancement helped
        me to bridge my database knowledge with frontend dashboard UI.
