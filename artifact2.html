      <h2>Artifact Overview</h2>
      <p>   This artifact is a Binary Search Tree (BST) program that is written in C++. It was originally developed for CS 300: Data Structures and Algorithms. It was made to show off the abilities to use a BST for insertion, deletion, and in order traversal.  However, I wanted to add a way to filter data and then sort it. So, I added the ability to soft by less than a winning bid amount and then filter it by either data of department. </p>

      <h3>Justification</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Added bid filtering by maximum winning amount.</li>
        <li>Implemented sorting by department or date.</li>
        <li>Added validation for user inputs.</li>
        <li>Developed a <code>dateToInt()</code> function to accurately sort date strings.</li>
        <li>Cleaned up code and improved documentation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Program Outcomes Demonstrated</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Applied algorithmic principles to design efficient filtering and sorting mechanisms.</li>
        <li>Showcased use of tree traversal, custom comparison logic, and search operations.</li>
        <li>Balanced program usability with computational efficiency and clarity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>   Enhancing this artifact taught me a lot about balancing usability with efficiency. One of the hardest challenges I faced was sorting the string formatted dates. At first, I couldn’t figure out why my date sort was not working currently. After looking at it for some time I realized C++ was just doing a string compare. So, I decided to break the string apart and put it back together as an integer that would be sortable. This was a reminder of how important data formatting and data processing can be.</p>
