        <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p>
          As I look back at my journey through the computer science program and
          the development of my ePortfolio, I can say that I have definitely
          grown in both the technical and professional sense. This program has
          helped me to refine my strengths, strengthen my weaknesses, learn new
          tools and practices, and prepare myself for the Software development
          industry. Completing this ePortfolio gave me the opportunity to look
          back at past projects, enhance them with new skills I have developed,
          and clearly showcase my abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the program, I’ve gained hands-on experience in important
          areas of computer science. These would include software design,
          algorithms and data structures, and databases. My first artifact, a
          GUI investment calculator, shows how I was able to transform a basic
          C++ console app into a working Python application with a modern
          looking GUI. This shows my growth in software engineering and UI
          design, as well as my ability to adapt to solutions across different
          programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          My second artifact, a Binary Search Tree, shows my ability to work
          with complex data structures and apply efficient sorting and filtering
          algorithms. Enhancing this artifact involved adding user-defined
          filters and sorting logic, which helped me to add to my understanding
          of algorithmic thinking and performance-first thinking. To filter the
          data, the code performs an in-order traversal of the BST with a time
          complexity of O(n). Once filtered, the results are sorted based on the
          user selection using std::sort, which runs at a (m log m) complexity,
          where m is the number of filtered bids. This way of doing the
          filtering and sorting is great to keep the time complexity low while
          also giving the user the intended functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          My third and final artifact is a Dash-based dashboard built on top of
          a MongoDB data set, which really shows off my full stack abilities.
          The enhancement for this artifact included multiple UI improvements,
          new filters and sort options, along with an optimized backend for
          database queries. It represents my ability to bridge front-end design
          with backend data handling and showcases my ability to build an
          interactive tool to help users make informed decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          These projects also show my ability to collaborate and communicate
          effectively. This is really evident when doing system design for
          different users or audiences. From my enhancement planning to my code
          review video, I’ve practiced translating technical ideas and code into
          easy-to-understand language. This experience also highlighted the
          importance of security, as I needed to implement ways to validate user
          input and improve how data is handled in all of the applications. A
          good example is in artifact three where the database credentials are
          stored in environment variables, so they aren’t exposed in the code
          for anyone to see.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the technical growth, this program has also helped
          shape my professional goals. I’ve realized that I love building an
          automation environment, along with data-driven applications to help
          solve problems. I’m especially interested in careers that combine data
          automation to help users make informed decisions about real-world
          problems. In this type of career, I can continue to apply my
          understanding of UI, data structures, databases, and system
          scalability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, this ePortfolio brings together the strongest example of my
          work from the past 2 years, along with the knowledge I have learned
          from the field over the past 4 years. It shows how I have progressed
          as a computer scientist because of that experience. Each artifact
          shows a different aspect of my skill set, but together they show my
          well-rounded ability to design, build, and develop usable
          applications. I’m excited to carry over this experience into the next
          steps of my career!
