      <h2>Artifact Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The artifact I chose is the investment calculator that was originally
        written in CS 210. This project was designed for users to input
        initial investment, monthly deposit amounts, annual interest rate, and
        number of years. The original design had users inputting this data
        into the command line and didn’t offer any compounding frequency
        options. For the enchantment I decided to migrate the project for C++
        to Python and improve the functionality and usability. I did this by
        adding a GUI instead of command line. This upgrade not only helped to
        modernize the project but also helped to show off my software
        engineering, Ui development, and language understanding skills.

      <h3 class="section-title">Justification</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Migrated project from C++ to Python to demonstrate language
          adaptability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Added a Tkinter-based GUI for better usability and cross-platform
          support.
        </li>
        <li>
          Introduced compounding frequency options to add to functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented input validation to enhance reliability and security.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="section-title">Program Outcomes Demonstrated</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical Implementation:</strong> Demonstrated my ability
          to understand multiple programming languages and migrate the codebase from C++
          to Python while adding a modern GUI using Tkinter, improving both
          functionality and cross-platform usability.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <strong>Professional Communication:</strong> Improved the user
          experience by designing a clear, easy to use graphical interface,
          making the application useable by a bigger audience with less
          technical background.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <strong>Security Mindset:</strong> Incorporated input validation to
          prevent invalid or unsafe user entries. This improved the application's
          reliability by guarding against improper usage or input errors. 
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="section-title">Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        During the enhancement of this artifact, I learned a good bit about
        the differences between python and C++. Migrating the core
        functionality of the program while keeping the functionality intact
        was a bit challenging, however the hardest part was adding the
        compounding frequency calculations. Another challenge was making sure
        that the GUI was user friendly and easy on the eyes. Adding the
        compounding frequency dropdown and user inputs with labels required a
        good understanding of UI design. By adding a good UI and better error
        handling I enhanced the artifacts usability and made it compatible
        with multiple OS instead of just windows like the original. This
        project helped my understanding of GUI development with Tkinter and
        demonstrated my ability to migrate, enhance, and modernize software
        solutions.
